/**
 * The memory provider contract, version 1.
 *
 * A provider stores canonical v1 records and returns them. It never decides who may use a
 * record or for what: the learning store applies scope, consent, purpose, and approval rules
 * before anything reaches a provider and again on everything a provider returns. A provider
 * must:
 *
 * - keep records exactly, so their digests still verify;
 * - append and never rewrite: appendRecords accepts a record whose ID is new, skips one
 *   whose ID and digest are already stored, and throws an error with code "conflict",
 *   writing nothing from the batch, when an ID is stored with another digest;
 * - return records in the order they were appended, filtered by the query, as copies;
 * - append a memory version only when the latest stored version of that memory has the
 *   expected digest and the new version number is one higher, atomically, and otherwise
 *   throw an error with code "conflict";
 * - store a change and the audit entries that record it in one atomic write: appendRecords
 *   and appendMemoryVersion take those entries as options.audit and append them to the audit
 *   stream under the appendRecords rules. If any part is refused or fails, nothing from the
 *   call is stored, so a crash or an error never leaves a change without its audit entry;
 * - append to several streams in one atomic write: appendBatch(batch, { audit }) takes an
 *   object that maps stream names to records, follows the appendRecords rules in each stream,
 *   and stores every record and audit entry, or nothing. It returns { appended, existing } for
 *   each stream the batch names. appendRecords(stream, records, { audit }) is the same write for
 *   one stream;
 * - throw an error with code "invalid_input" for an unknown stream or a query without a scope.
 *
 * ProviderConflictError and LearningError are conveniences; any error with the right code works.
 *
 * Methods: manifest(), health(), appendRecords(stream, records, { audit }),
 * appendBatch(batch, { audit }), readRecords(stream, query),
 * appendMemoryVersion(record, { expectedPreviousDigest, audit }), readMemoryVersions(query), and
 * an optional close().
 *
 * A provider that declares the optional observation.redact capability also implements
 * redactRecord("events", record). It replaces a stored event, in place and in the same order,
 * with a redacted copy that keeps the event's ID and digest, has no payload, and says why in
 * redaction, naming the Hub comment when the event is a review comment. It returns
 * { redacted: false } when the stored event has no payload already, and throws not_found,
 * conflict, or invalid_input as redactionProblem describes. This is the only
 * rewrite the contract allows, because an event's digest leaves out its payload.
