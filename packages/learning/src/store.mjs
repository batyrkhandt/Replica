   * A scope holds one collection for each snapshot ID, and it records the digest of the

   * it, keeps the stored collection. A snapshot ID already imported with different contents is
   * refused, and the provider refuses a second collection for the snapshot ID in the same write
   * as the comments, so of two imports that race, only one is stored.
   *
   * A deletion retracts the comment from every purpose and keeps its text. With redactDeleted,
   * the import then removes the text of every comment the snapshot shows as deleted, and of
   * the labels on it, as redactComment does, recorded as the importer's action. It also
   * finishes a removal that an earlier import left incomplete. A host that erases deleted
   * comments, as Hub does, uses it so the store does not keep text the host has erased.
