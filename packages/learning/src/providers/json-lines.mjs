/**
 * Stores learning records as append-only JSON Lines files in one private directory. It
 * needs no service and no dependency, and a person can read its files, so it is the
 * reference provider. SQLite is the default.
 *
 * Each stream is <directory>/v1/<stream>.jsonl, created owner-only (0700 directories, 0600
 * files). Reads and writes take an exclusive lock file that only its holder removes; see
 * lock.mjs. A store whose directory does not exist yet reads as empty, and reading it creates
 * nothing. A line without its newline is never read as a record.
 *
 * After any crash or error, the store holds each write whole or not at all. A call that fails
 * has stored nothing, except when the disk reports an error while the write commits: then it
 * fails with storage_outcome_unknown, and the write may or may not be stored. Where Node.js can
 * sync directories, on Linux and macOS, the same holds after a power failure.
 *
 * Every write goes through a journal, <directory>/v1/.pending, whether it adds one record or an
 * import's episodes, events, collection, and audit entries:
 *
 * 1. Record the length of each file the write will change in .pending, and sync it and v1.
 * 2. Append to each file and sync it. Before this provider's first commit, sync every directory
 *    from v1 up to the top of its file system, because another process may have created part of
 *    the path and not synced it yet. After that, sync v1 if the write created a stream file.
 * 3. Add the commit line to .pending and sync it. That sync is the commit point: after it, the
 *    write succeeds, whatever happens while closing or deleting .pending.
 * 4. Delete .pending and sync v1.
 *
 * A write that fails before the commit point is undone before the error is reported: cut each
 * file back and sync it, and delete .pending. Once the commit line may be on the disk, the
 * files are cut back only after dropping that line and syncing .pending both succeed. Otherwise
 * every file stays whole with .pending, and the call fails with storage_outcome_unknown, because
 * recovery keeps the whole write or none of it, depending on whether the line survived.
 *
 * Before each read and write, the lock holder finishes a write that stopped: it keeps a
 * committed one and cuts back any other, so no read sees part of a write. The parent of each
 * directory the provider creates is also synced when it creates it.
 *
 * Compared with SQLite, reads and writes take turns, a redaction leaves the old events file's
 * bytes in free disk space where SQLite overwrites removed text, writes sync more often, and on
 * Windows a power failure can lose a newly created file's directory entry.
 *
 * The provider opens its files without following links, and refuses v1 or a file in it that
 * is a link, has a second name, or resolves outside the directory.
